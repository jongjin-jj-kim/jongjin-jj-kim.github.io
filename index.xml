      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;principles-of-statistics-my-last-course-of-teaching-at-ucf&#34;&gt;Principles of Statistics: My Last Course of Teaching at UCF&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Summer 2024, I had the opportunity to teach &lt;strong&gt;STA 2014: Principles of Statistics&lt;/strong&gt; for the final time at the University of Central Florida. Unlike a regular semester, this was an intensive 6-week course, requiring significant revisions to the course structure. I revised the number of exams, adjusted the grading policy, and reorganized the lesson plan from a 1-hour class to a 2-hour class. Reducing the number of exams helped improve the course structure, with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapters 1-2&lt;/strong&gt; covering introduction and descriptive statistics,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapters 3-5&lt;/strong&gt; focusing on probabilities, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapters 6-7&lt;/strong&gt; addressing inferential statistics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I reviewed and revised the quiz and homework problems to better align with the class materials, which made the course more coherent and effective. Iâ€™m pleased that I successfully completed my last semester of teaching at UCF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;syllabus&#34;&gt;Syllabus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;selected-student-comments-from-the-student-perception-of-instruction-spi&#34;&gt;Selected Student Comments from the Student Perception of Instruction (SPI)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for the positive feedback from my students, which highlights the effectiveness of my teaching approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I appreciated how thoroughly he went over the material and recognized that it was a long class, giving us a 10-minute break in the middle. He was clear and concise, and when he could tell we were confused, he spent extra time going over examples. Overall, he&amp;rsquo;s definitely one of the best professors I&amp;rsquo;ve had.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I greatly appreciated the instructor&amp;rsquo;s ability to make complex statistical concepts accessible and engaging. His clear explanations helped demystify challenging topics, making learning both enjoyable and effective. His willingness to answer questions and provide additional support showed a genuine commitment to our success. Overall, his teaching style was both inspiring and practical, greatly enhancing my understanding of the material.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I appreciated the instructor&amp;rsquo;s enthusiasm in helping students understand challenging topics. His teaching style was amazing and made complex concepts much easier to grasp. Overall, his lectures greatly enhanced my understanding of the material.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-and-reflections&#34;&gt;Challenges and Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges I faced was having to leave Orlando and move to Virginia after this semester. Despite this, I was able to successfully complete the course.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;principles-of-statistics-course-improvement&#34;&gt;Principles of Statistics: Course Improvement&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2024, I had the opportunity to teach &lt;strong&gt;STA 2014: Principles of Statistics&lt;/strong&gt; again at the University of Central Florida. This semester brought new challenges, notably a smaller classroom space and the absence of a document camera, which made reviewing worksheets more difficult. Additionally, I had two older students who struggled with the mathematical content, both of whom informed me that it took them over 20 hours to complete the first homework. My goal was to ensure that no student was left behind. Based on feedback from the previous semester, I integrated more practical use of the statistical tool &lt;strong&gt;StatCrunch&lt;/strong&gt;, which was well-received by the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;syllabus&#34;&gt;Syllabus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;course-activities&#34;&gt;Course Activities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the semester, students participated in activities aimed at reinforcing their understanding of statistical methods, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekly problem sets and quizzes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-class &lt;strong&gt;StatCrunch&lt;/strong&gt; exercises, replacing external tools to streamline learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I provided a review sample questions before the exam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;student-feedback-on-ratemyprofessor&#34;&gt;Student Feedback on RateMyProfessor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received comments on RateMyProfessor for the first time, and I am grateful for the positive feedback, which highlights the impact of my teaching approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Very chill. Anytime I had an issue with an assignment, he would give me help and extra time. Super easy A if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to learn basic statistics. #Caring #Accessible_outside_class #Online_Savvy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;This was my favorite professor at UCF so far. He is very understanding and will reopen assignments if there are technical issues. He also has very good lectures and makes them easy to understand. Attendance is not mandatory but I highly suggest it because his lectures make it much easier to comprehend. He is also overall extremely nice and funny. #Amazing_Lectures #Gives_Good_Feedback #Caring&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-and-reflections&#34;&gt;Challenges and Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One challenge I encountered was low classroom attendance, as attendance was not mandatory. This resulted in students missing out on important in-class exercises, and even some students not participating in the &lt;strong&gt;Student Perception of Instruction (SPI)&lt;/strong&gt; survey, which accounted for 2% of their final grade. Additionally, I noticed a discrepancy between homework and quiz performance on &lt;strong&gt;MyLab&lt;/strong&gt; compared to the content of my lectures. I plan to address this in future courses by aligning these assessments more closely with my lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spi-score&#34;&gt;SPI Score&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;principles-of-statistics-my-first-course-of-teaching&#34;&gt;Principles of Statistics: My First Course of Teaching&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2023, I had the privilege of teaching &lt;strong&gt;STA 2014: Principles of Statistics&lt;/strong&gt; at the University of Central Florida. This course introduced students to fundamental statistical concepts, covering topics such as descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;syllabus&#34;&gt;Syllabus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;course-activities&#34;&gt;Course Activities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the semester, students engaged in activities designed to deepen their understanding of statistical methods, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekly problem sets and quizzes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-class worksheets that promoted hands-on learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;selected-student-comments-from-the-student-perception-of-instruction-spi&#34;&gt;Selected Student Comments from the Student Perception of Instruction (SPI)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for the positive feedback from my students, which highlights the impact of my teaching approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I liked how nice he was and how he tried his best to explain everything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with learning math my whole life, and the professor made learning statistics much easier.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;What I liked best about the course was how helpful my teacher was during class. Whenever I or any of my classmates had a question, he was very quick to help us either one-on-one or in front of the class.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;teaching-philosophy&#34;&gt;Teaching Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My teaching philosophy centers around active learning. I allocate the last 10 minutes of each class for students to practice examples using worksheets, helping to reinforce the day&amp;rsquo;s concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-and-reflections&#34;&gt;Challenges and Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter part of the course relied heavily on computations using external tools. While I introduced these tools as I found them, they were not fully integrated into the course structure, which posed a challenge for both the students and myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spi-score&#34;&gt;SPI Score&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
